# Search ja.is
Search ja.is is an extension for the [Gnome Desktop environment](http://www.gnome.org/) that shows search results from [ja.is](http://ja.is/) in the Gnome search overview.

It shold be noted that this extension is not connected to the organization *Já Upplýsingaveitur hf* in any way.

The currently supported Gnome versions are Gnome 3.6 and Gnome 3.8 but at the moment the extension is only available for Gnome 3.6 if installed from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/691/search-jais/), 

### Installation
The easiest way to install this extension is through the [Gnome extension website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/691/search-jais/). From there, the rest is very straight forward.

If you want to install the extension from the git repo just clone the repo and place the `ja@axelingolfsson.gmail.com/` folder in `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`. In order to activate the extension you have to restart your gnome session. To do that, press `ALT+F2`, type "r" and press return.
